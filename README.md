  A fast, friendly, and focused Android mod manager for Discord — rebranded for the ShiggyCord community from Wintry.
</p>

## ✨ Why Shiggy Manager?

Shiggy Manager makes installing and managing Discord mods simple and safe. It's built from the ground up by Aliucord Team with reliability and UX in mind, and changed to work with new versions by Wintry Team:
- Clean, ShiggyCord-branded UI and icons
- Safe vector handling to avoid runtime inflation issues
- Fast install/update workflows

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

<p><strong>Download & run</strong> — get a released APK from Releases and install with:</p>

Get newest apk from [release list](https://github.com/kmmiio99o/ShiggyManager/releases/) and install it.

<p><strong>Build from source</strong> — clone and assemble:</p>

```ShiggyManager/README.md#L411-418
git clone https://github.com/kmmiio99o/ShiggyManager.git
cd ShiggyManager
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

APK output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## ⚙️ Features

- One-tap install, update, or remove of supported mods
- About screen with contributors and "fun facts"
- Safe vector drawable usage (vector groups + scale/translate)
- Customizable branding via resources (colors, icons, strings)

---

## 🎨 Customization & Theming

You can fully tailor the appearance:

- App name: edit `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` — ensure the UI uses `@string/app_name`.
- Icons: swap `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_rounded_shiggy.xml` and `ic_discord_shiggy.xml` with your vector or PNG.
- Colors: use `colors.xml` to apply a new palette.
- Glyph sizing: vector drawables support `<group android:scaleX="" android:scaleY="" android:translateX="" android:translateY="">`. To center an element after scaling, compute translation as:

```ShiggyManager/README.md#L419-426
translate = (viewportSize - (viewportSize * scale)) / 2
# Example for viewport 256 and scale 0.7 -> translate = 38.4
```

If you see a missing space in the name (e.g., `ShiggyManager`), search for usages of `@string/shiggy` — that key intentionally contains the compact brand name. Prefer `@string/app_name` for UI labels that expect "Shiggy Manager".

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- Vector inflation errors:
  - Check `adb logcat` for FATAL EXCEPTION and the drawable path.
  - Validate vector XML: no unsupported attributes, proper `pathData`.
  - If issues persist, consider a `layer-list` reference to the launcher icon or a PNG fallback.
